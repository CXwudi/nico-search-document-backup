# nico-search-document-backup

This is backup of the Niconico Douga "Snapshot Search API v2" Guide.

Since the recovery of the NicoNico Douga service on August 5th 2024, the [official documentation page](https://site.nicovideo.jp/search-api-docs/snapshot) is always 403 forbiddened.

Fortunately, [Wayback Machine](http://wayback.archive.org/) has a backup on [March 2nd 2024](https://web.archive.org/web/20240302072321/https://site.nicovideo.jp/search-api-docs/snapshot)

This repo is simply a personal backup of this documentation, since it is a quite powerful search feature that only NicoNico Douga has.

I also translated it to English through Gemini 1.5 Pro 0801.
