# nico-search-document-backup

This is a backup of the Niconico Douga "Snapshot Search API v2" Guide.

For those who are not aware, Niconico has a very powerful search API for programmatic usage, which is very suitable for big data analysis.

However, since the recovery of the NicoNico Douga service on August 5th, 2024, the [official documentation page](https://site.nicovideo.jp/search-api-docs/snapshot) has always been 403 forbidden.

Fortunately, the [Wayback Machine](http://wayback.archive.org/) has a backup from [March 2nd, 2024](https://web.archive.org/web/20240302072321/https://site.nicovideo.jp/search-api-docs/snapshot).

This repository is simply a personal backup of this documentation. I have also converted the original HTML into Markdown and translated it into English, all using Gemini 1.5 Pro 0801.
